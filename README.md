# General Store
```
You and your team are responsible for creating constructors for the products you sell in your general store
Start by creating a basic product constructor with the properties that apply to all products
Then create two more specific constructors that inherit from the product constructor
```

# RPG Character Creator
```
Create a Character constructor with properties for name, Hit Points (HP), Magic Points (MP), and weapon type
Create a Wizard constructor that inherits from Character and also has properties for elemental type and summon name
Create a Soldier constructor that inherits from Character and also has properties for rank and banner name
Create an Assassin constructor that inherits from Character and also has properties for stealth skill and poison name
Use inquirer to prompt a user to create either a wizard, a soldier, or an assassin
Based on what the user chooses prompt them again for the data needed to create the specified character
Once the user has entered in all the data, create a new Instance of your Wizard, Soldier, or Assasin and log it to the console
BONUS: After the user has created their character, return them to the first prompt to begin creating another character
